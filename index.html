            <p>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.[6] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use.[7] Birds are usually categorised as a biological class in traditional evolutionary taxonomy. Modern phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda, sometimes with a Linnean rank lower than class, such as subclass[8] or infraclass.[9]

Definition
Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[10] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of moder</p>Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx, traditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. These proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term "bird" by these researchers.[13]

 Birds

The birds' phylogenetic relationships to major living reptile groups. (The turtles' position is uncertain: Some authorities embed them inside the Archosaurs, with birds and crocodiles.)
Aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles (alternately Avemetatarsalia)
Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers (alternately Avifilopluma)
Aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae)
Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes)
The latter included the superficially gull-like Ichthyornis[42] and the Hesperornithiformes, which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.[36] The early euornithians also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithians retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).[43] Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers,[44] which may have replaced the "hind wing" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.[35]

            <p>Anatomy is the scientific study of the structures of a living organism, while physiology is the study of how those structures function and work together. The two disciplines are intrinsically linked and are typically studied together because the function of an organ or system is directly related to its physical form. For example, an anatomist might study the four chambers of the heart, while a physiologist would investigate how those chambers pump blood throughout the body. 
Anatomy: The study of structure
Anatomy focuses on the "what" and "where" of the body's components, which are organized in a hierarchy from the smallest to the largest. 
Microscopic anatomy: Also known as histology, this branch requires a microscope to examine the fine details of the body's tissues (histology) and cells (cytology).
Gross anatomy: Also known as macroscopic anatomy, this is the study of larger body structures that are visible to the naked eye. It can be further divided:
Regional anatomy: Focuses on the structures within a specific body region, such as the head or chest.
Systemic anatomy: Examines the structures that make up a distinct organ system, like the nervous or cardiovascular system.
Imaging techniques: Modern advancements allow for non-invasive examination of internal structures using methods like X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans. 
Physiology: The study of function
Physiology focuses on the chemical and physical processes that enable life, explaining the "how" and "why" of body functions. A central theme in physiology is homeostasis, the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. 
Cellular physiology: Explores the function and communication of cells, the basic units of life.
Systemic physiology: Looks at the integrated function of the body's organ systems, such as the respiratory system's gas exchange or the digestive system's nutrient absorption.
Pathophysiology: Studies how normal physiological functions are disrupted during disease states. 
The structure-function relationship
The connection between anatomy and physiology is so fundamental that it is often frustrating to study one without the other. This close relationship is evident throughout all levels of biological organization. 
The heart: The four-chambered anatomy of the heart is perfectly designed for its physiological function of pumping blood through separate pulmonary and systemic circuits.
The hand: The unique arrangement of the bones, muscles, and nerves in the human hand (anatomy) allows for the precise and diverse movements (physiology) needed for tasks like writing and grasping. 
By understanding both the structure and function of the body, healthcare professionals can better diagnose, treat, and prevent illness.
